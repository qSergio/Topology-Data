# Topology for Data Analysis using R
============================

An example of an application of topological ideas in data analysis. It's a simple exercise that uses the R package *"TDA"* to study a car-accidents dataset. 

*Topology* can be used to support Machine Learning to obtain important and robust features before starting the usual machinery. __ML__ benefits from geometrical insight, showing this, with a nice problem, is the point of this example.

The dataset can be found in [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk) and it's really interesting by itself.
