# Topology-for-Data-Analysis
============================

An example of an application of topological ideas in data analysis. We use R package "TDA" to study a car-accidents dataset. 

Topology can be used to support Machine Learning to obtain important and robust features before starting the usual path and ML benefits from geometrical insight, to show this with a nice problem is the point of this exercise.

The dataset can be found in [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk) ad is very interesting for other kind of comparison.
